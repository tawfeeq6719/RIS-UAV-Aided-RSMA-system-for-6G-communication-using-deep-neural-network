# RIS-UAV-Aided-RSMA-system-for-6G-communication-using-deep-neural-network

1.) This is my B.tech final year project .

2.) In this project , I have introduced a DNN(deep nural network) model to predict outage probability for corresponding SINR ( signal to Noise ratio ) with better accuracy compared to the DNN model that were introduced earlier .

3.) this are the performance metrics of my DNN model :
  
      a.) Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.00034780066240347614
      
      b.) Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.013297066592437177
      
      c.) Root Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.01864941453245855
      
      d.) R-squared: 0.997514203660172
